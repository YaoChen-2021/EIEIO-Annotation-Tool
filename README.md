# Description
The Electron Impact Excitation of Ions from Organics (EIEIO) annotation tool is an untargeted liquid chromatography-EIEIO tandem mass spectrometry (LC-EIEIO-MS/MS) data processing tool for in-depth analysis of lipid structure. This tool can accurately annotate the sum composition, _sn_-position, and C=C position of multiclass lipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), ceramide (Cer), diacylglycerol (DG), and triacylglycerol (TG). By summarizing the fragmentation principles of many lipid isomers in the positive ion EIEIO spectra, three index libraries were generated to realize the annotation of lipid structure. 
## Details of The Annotation Tool
There are six sequential steps in the annotation tool: 1) extracting MS information, 2) classifying lipids, 3) aligning sum composition, 4) determining _sn_-positions, 5) locating C=C positions, and 6) ascertaining annotation levels. More details about this tool can be found in our article. 
# User Guide 
1. Create a folder named "input-mzml" in the downloaded package before running the _summary.py_ script. This tool supports the mzML file format of the LC-MS raw data and only need to run the _summary.py_ to get the final output file after downloading this folder.For the traceability of the identification results, the temporary results obtained in each step were saved. Therefore, in order to simplify the operation, the six steps were integrated and run in the _summary.py_ script.
2. It is recommended to convert the original data into mzml format in the MSConvert software by following the steps shown in the picture below.

# Supplementary Information   
1. Annotation process of the plasmalogen and alkyl lipids. it is noteworthy that distinct diagnostic ion index libraries have been constructed for both based on the corresponding lipid standards, which include sum composition, sn- and C=C positions. During the third step of our analytical protocol, if a parent ion can match the theoretical parent ions of both plasmalogen and alkyl lipids, the results of these two matches are saved separately. These sum compositions are then subjected to further analysis in step 4, utilizing the respective sn-index libraries for plasmalogen and alkyl lipids. When the final output table has the same parent ions and retention times for both plasmalogen and alkyl lipids, this indicates that the annotations were derived from the same EIEIO spectra. To ensure accuracy, we recommend selecting plasmalogen or alkyl lipids annotated at the higher annotation level described in this work for subsequent analyses or checking the data manually.
2. It is worth mentioning that the 0.01 Da tolerance in MS1 is the default value in our tool. This value can be modified in line 10 and 26 of the step3.py file according to individual needs.
